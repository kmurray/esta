/*
 * The ParallelLevelizedTimingAnalyzer implements the TimingAnalyzer interface, providing
 * a parallel (multi-core) timing analyzer that runs faster than the standard SerialTimingAnalyzer.
 *
 * Like the SerialTimingAnalyzer the timing graph is walked in a levelized manner where each
 * preceeding level is fully evaluated before the next is processed.  However, within each level
 * nodes are processed in parallel.
 *
 * This allows a reasonably parrallelization provided levels are sufficiently wide. If however,
 * levels are too small this can result in an extremely fine-grained parallelization where the
 * parallelization overhead overwhelms any potential speed-up.  This poor behaviour is avoided
 * by evaluating serially levels that not 'sufficiently' large.
